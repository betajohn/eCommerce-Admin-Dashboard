## Information to collect during payments

### Payment Information

This includes credit card or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes. Store this data securely and consider encrypting it to prevent unauthorized access.

> Not sure if payment processor will share that info with me. Paypal doesn't.

### Billing Information

Collect and store the customer's billing address, including their name, address, city, state, and ZIP code. This information is essential for verification purposes and may be required for fraud prevention.

### Transaction IDs

Keep track of unique transaction identifiers provided by your payment gateway or processor. These IDs help reconcile transactions and troubleshoot any payment-related issues.

## Session Information

Temporarily store session IDs or tokens to track user sessions during the checkout process. This helps maintain continuity if the user navigates away from the page and returns later to complete the transaction.

Remember to adhere to data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States when collecting and storing customer data.

Minimize the amount of sensitive information you retain, and implement robust security measures to safeguard stored data against unauthorized access or breaches. Additionally, regularly review and update your data storage practices to align with evolving security standards and compliance requirements.

### Session ID or Token

A unique identifier generated by your server and assigned to each user session. This ID allows you to track and manage the user's interactions with your website while they are actively engaged, from adding items to their cart to completing the checkout process. It's essential for maintaining session state across multiple pages or interactions.

### Cart Contents

Temporarily store information about the items that the user has added to their shopping cart during their session. This typically includes details such as product IDs, quantities, prices, and any other relevant attributes. Storing this data allows users to navigate between different pages on your site without losing the contents of their cart.

### User Preferences

If your website offers customization options or preferences that users can set during their session (e.g., preferred payment method, shipping options, language preferences), you may need to store this information temporarily. This ensures that their selections are retained as they progress through the checkout process.

### Error Messages or Notifications

Store any error messages or notifications that occur during the checkout process. For example, if a user enters invalid payment information or encounters an issue with their order, you can display relevant messages and store them temporarily to provide context if the user navigates back to the previous step.

### Authentication Status

If users need to log in or create an account to complete their purchase, store temporary authentication tokens or flags to indicate their logged-in status during the session. This allows you to personalize the checkout experience and retrieve relevant user information, such as saved addresses or payment methods.

### Referral Source

Optionally, you can track the referral source that brought the user to your website during their session (e.g., a specific marketing campaign, affiliate link, or search engine). This information can be valuable for analyzing the effectiveness of your marketing efforts and optimizing your conversion funnel.

## Common terms

### Billing Information

With identity theft a real problem, banks are doing as much as they can to protect customers and businesses from any form of online fraud. One such way is for the buyer to provide their billing information.

### What Is a Billing Address?

```text
A billing address is the address associated with the payment method used to make a purchase.

It's typically the address where the cardholder receives their credit card or bank statements.

Billing addresses are used for verification purposes to help prevent fraudulent transactions and ensure that the payment information provided matches the billing address on file with the card issuer or bank.

Legal Requirements.- Depending on your jurisdiction and the nature of your business, you may be required by law to collect and store billing address information for accounting, tax, or compliance purposes. Ensure that you understand the applicable regulations related to data collection and storage in your region.

### What Is the Difference Between a Billing Address and a Shipping Address?

```text
our billing address and your shipping address have two separate functions. Although they are quite commonly confused with one another.

Credit or debit card statements, or any other billing information, will be sent to your billing address. Whereas things such as your online orders, packages or any other shipping products will be sent to your shipping address. They are quite often the same address.

Billing addresses can help to prevent identity theft via the Address Verification System, otherwise known as AVS.

### Why should I store billing addresses?

- Legal Requirements: Depending on your jurisdiction and the nature of your business, you may be required by law to collect and store billing address information for accounting, tax, or compliance purposes. Ensure that you understand the applicable regulations related to data collection and storage in your region.

- Payment Processing: Payment processors and financial institutions often require billing address information to verify the authenticity of transactions and reduce the risk of fraud. Storing billing addresses can help with transaction validation and dispute resolution, especially for high-value purchases.

- Fraud Prevention: Verifying the billing address provided by the customer against the address on file with the card issuer or bank is a common method used to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. Storing billing address data enables you to perform address verification checks (AVS) during the payment authorization process.

- Customer Experience: While collecting billing address information may be necessary for security and compliance reasons, it's essential to balance security requirements with the convenience and privacy expectations of your customers. Minimize the amount of personal data collected to only what's necessary for transaction processing, and clearly communicate your data handling practices in your privacy policy.

- Data Security: If you choose to store billing address data, implement robust security measures to protect it from unauthorized access, misuse, or data breaches. Use encryption protocols, access controls, and regular security audits to safeguard sensitive customer information.

- Anonymization and Retention Policies: Consider implementing anonymization techniques or data retention policies to limit the storage duration of billing address data to only what's necessary for business operations and compliance purposes. Regularly review and update your data management practices to align with evolving security standards and regulatory requirements.
