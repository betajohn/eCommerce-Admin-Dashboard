## PO: Purchase Order

> Purchase orders are issued from the buyer to the seller to formally confirm purchases

```text
The customer issues a purchase order to ensure they receive exactly what they will purchase.

Purchase orders specify what should be in the order and when it should arrive, are initially issued by the customer to the vendor.

Only after approving the purchase order does a seller send an invoice. For finance to confirm that the data on both forms is the same, suppliers typically include the purchase order number (PO number) listed on the original purchase order when issuing invoices.
```

> Purchase Orders Provide Ground For Legal Defense

```text
Purchase orders eliminate uncertainties by forming a legally enforceable agreement between the parties and acting as a transaction record.
When a vendor receives and accepts a purchase order, you are obligated to uphold your half of the deal.

Note: For a purchase order to be effective, it must be delivered to the seller. Only after the seller "acknowledges" the purchase order by signing it does the document acquire legal force.
```

> Purchase Orders Facilitate Order Tracking

```text
Purchase orders enable you to keep better track of all the products and services your business has bought, how you're paying for them, and when they're due to arrive.

From an operational perspective, knowing that your supplier is contractually required to deliver orders at a given time and date gives you more confidence to track orders.

Accounting-wise, you may budget with assurance knowing that you have a legally enforceable purchase price.
```

> The vendor then decides whether they can and want to fulfill the order after receiving the purchase order. They must authorize the purchase order before it is enforceable.

### Example Of A Purchase Order And Its Elements

```text
Its style is irrelevant, but a purchase order must include these components:

PO (Purchase Order) number
Date of the purchase order
Name of the vendor
Billing address
Shipping address
Additional contact details, such as email addresses and phone numbers
Date of delivery
Shipping method
Shipping conditions
Item name
Item details and technical data
Item number
Cost per unit
Total line
Taxes
Total cost
Terms of payment
```

```text
Purchase orders are uniform throughout the whole organization and include, at a minimum, details about the buyer and seller (names, addresses), the order itself (product description, technical specifications, price, quantity), and payment conditions (due date and form of payment, e.g., bank transfer, credit card).
```

## SO: Sales Order

> For accounting and inventory purposes, the sales order is a crucial document

> Sales orders are internal documents that suppliers create for clients.

```text
A sales order is a legal document that is provided to a customer by a seller. It certifies the exchange of products or services and specifies the transaction's particulars, such as the volume, cost, and standard of the delivered items or services.

The estimated delivery date, delivery address, payment terms, and other terms and logistics of the transaction are also disclosed. A sales order, often known as a SO, is a record that the seller creates and maintains internally. It enables firms to rapidly and precisely track inventories and orders.

Manufacturers, retailers, online B2B wholesalers, and suppliers stand to gain the most from this. It serves as a technique to validate a purchase before the goods or services are actually provided.

Vendors communicate with buyers via sales orders to confirm a transaction before the order has been processed.
```

## Invoice

```text
An invoice is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer, indicating the products or services provided, the quantities, prices, and terms of sale. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller. Invoices are typically issued before or at the time of delivery of goods or completion of services. They provide a record of the transaction for both the buyer and the seller and are used for accounting and tracking purposes.
```

> Key components of an invoice include:

```text
Seller Information: Name, address, contact details, and any relevant identifiers of the seller.
Buyer Information: Name, address, contact details, and any relevant identifiers of the buyer.
Invoice Number: A unique identifier assigned to the invoice for tracking and reference purposes.
Invoice Date: The date on which the invoice is issued.
Description of Goods/Services: Details of the products sold or services rendered, including quantities, unit prices, and any applicable taxes or discounts.
Total Amount Due: The sum total of the invoice, including any taxes, fees, or discounts.
Payment Terms: The terms specifying when and how payment should be made, including due date, acceptable payment methods, and any late payment penalties.
Terms and Conditions: Any additional terms or conditions relevant to the transaction, such as return policies or warranties.
Additional Information: Any other relevant information, such as shipping details or reference numbers.
```

## Bill vs Invoice vs Receipt

> They are all different

### Bill

```text
Requests payment for services already provided.

Commonly used interchangeably with invoice so beware.
```

### Invoice

```text
Requests payment before or at the time of delivery of goods or completion of services.
```

### Receipt

> Document that serves as evidence of a financial transaction. A receipt is the proof of payment.

```text
Written acknowledgment that money or goods have been received. It provides documentation of the transaction, including details such as the date, amount received, the purpose of the payment, and the parties involved.

It is a document confirming that a customer received the goods or services they paid a business for — or, conversely, that the business was appropriately compensated for the goods or services they sold to a customer. Though businesses are not legally required to provide a receipt for all transactions, receipts are virtually always given to a customer after they make a purchase, making them common among both traditional and e-commerce businesses.

Many e-commerce businesses send email receipts immediately after the customer makes a purchase.
```

```text
Creating a receipt is even simpler than creating an invoice, as they are much less detailed. They still contain important information about a transaction, however. They don’t require a unique identification number or customer information, but every receipt you issue should include:

Your business name, logo, and contact information;
The date of sale;
An itemized list of sold products and services;
The price of each sold product and service;
Any discounts or coupons;
The total amount paid, including any sales tax or fees.
Some receipts may also include the payment method, the terms of sale, or your organization’s return policy, as this information can be useful for customers to have if they wish to make a return or exchange. Order errors and returns have a huge impact on your customers and their experience with your business; providing as much detail as possible can make it that much easier for both of you to fix any issues that may arise.
