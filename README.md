### width and height in css

- default width and default height = 'content area' | 'border area' (box-sizing:border-box)

- 100% of the screen: If you want to set the height of a div or any element to full screen, you should set the height of body and html to 100% too. Then you can set the height of element with 100%

```css
body,
html {
  height: 100%;
}
```
